{"id": "faq_001", "question": "What is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud?", "answer": "Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can also create a hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter. You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon VPC. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that have access to the Internet, and place your backend systems such as databases or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_002", "question": "What are the components of Amazon VPC?", "answer": "Amazon VPC comprises a variety of objects that will be familiar to customers with existing networks: A Virtual Private Cloud: A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud. You define a VPC’s IP address space from ranges you select. Subnet: A segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources. Internet Gateway: The Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public Internet. NAT Gateway: A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources in a private subnet to access the Internet. Virtual private gateway: The Amazon VPC side of a VPN connection. Peering Connection: A peering connection enables you to route traffic via private IP addresses between two peered VPCs. VPC Endpoints: Enables private connectivity to services hosted in AWS, from within your VPC without using an Internet Gateway, VPN, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or firewall proxies. Egress-only Internet Gateway: A stateful gateway to provide egress only access for IPv6 traffic from the VPC to the Internet.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_003", "question": "Why should I use Amazon VPC?", "answer": "Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud - no VPNs, hardware, or physical datacenters required.

{"id": "faq_013", "question": "How do instances without public IP addresses access the Internet?", "answer": "Instances without public IP addresses can access the Internet in one of two ways: Instances without public IP addresses can route their traffic through a NAT gateway or a NAT instance to access the Internet. These instances use the public IP address of the NAT gateway or NAT instance to traverse the Internet. The NAT gateway or NAT instance allows outbound communication but doesn’t allow machines on the Internet to initiate a connection to the privately addressed instances. For VPCs with a hardware VPN connection or Direct Connect connection, instances can route their Internet traffic down the virtual private gateway to your existing datacenter. From there, it can access the Internet via your existing egress points and network security/monitoring devices.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}

{"id": "faq_025", "question": "Can I use all the IP addresses that I assign to a subnet?", "answer": "No. Amazon reserves the first four (4) IP addresses and the last one (1) IP address of every subnet for IP networking purposes.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_026", "question": "How do I assign private IP addresses to Amazon EC2 instances within a VPC?", "answer": "When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance within a subnet that is not IPv6-only, you may optionally specify the primary private IPv4 address for the instance. If you do not specify the primary private IPv4 address, AWS automatically addresses it from the IPv4 address range you assign to that subnet. You can assign secondary private IPv4 addresses when you launch an instance, when you create an Elastic Network Interface, or any time after the instance has been launched or the interface has been created. In case you launch an Amazon EC2 instance within an IPv6-only subnet, AWS automatically addresses it from the Amazon-provided IPv6 GUA CIDR of that subnet.

{"id": "faq_033", "question": "Why should I use BYOIP?", "answer": "You may want to bring your own IP addresses to AWS for the following reasons: IP Reputation: Many customers consider the reputation of their IP addresses to be a strategic asset and want to use those IPs on AWS with their resources. For example, customers who maintain services such as outbound e-mail MTA and have high reputation IPs, can now bring over their IP space and successfully maintain their existing sending success rate. Customer whitelisting: BYOIP also enables customers to move workloads that rely on IP address whitelisting to AWS without the need to re-establish the whitelists with new IP addresses. Hardcoded dependencies: Several customers have IPs hardcoded in devices or have taken architectural dependencies on their IPs. BYOIP enables such customers hassle free migration to AWS. Regulation and compliance: Many customers are required to use certain IPs because of regulation and compliance reasons. They too are unlocked by BYOIP. On-prem IPv6 network policy: Many customers can route only their IPv6 in their on-prem network. These customers are unlocked by BYOIP as they can assign their own IPv6 range to their VPC and choose to route to their on-prem network using internet or Direct Connect.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}

{"id": "faq_042", "question": "What is VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM)?", "answer": "Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) is a managed service that makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for your AWS workloads. Using IPAM, you can easily organize IP addresses based on your routing and security needs and set simple business rules to govern IP address assignments. You can also automate IP address assignment to VPCs, eliminating the need to use spreadsheet-based or homegrown IP address planning applications, which can be hard to maintain and time-consuming. IPAM provides a unified operational view, which can be used as your single source of truth, enabling you to quickly and efficiently perform routine IP address management activities such as tracking IP utilization, troubleshooting, and auditing.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_043", "question": "Why should you use IPAM?", "answer": "You should use IPAM to make IP address management more efficient. Existing mechanisms that leverage spreadsheets or home-grown tools require manual work, and are error-prone. With IPAM, as an example, you can roll out applications faster as your developers no longer need to wait for the central IP address administration team to allocate IP addresses. You can also detect overlapping IP addresses and fix them before there is a network outage. In addition, you can create alarms for IPAM to notify you if the address pools are nearing exhaustion or if resources fail to comply with allocations rules set on a pool. These are some of the many reasons you should use IPAM.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}

Monitor IP usage across your network: IPAM can monitor IP addresses and enables you to get alerts when IPAM detects potential issues such as depleting IP addresses that can stall network’s growth or overlapping IP addresses that can result in erroneous routing. Troubleshoot your network: IPAM can help you quickly identify if connectivity issues are due to IP address misconfigurations or other issues. Audit IP addresses: IPAM automatically retains your IP address monitoring data (up to a maximum of three years). You can use this historical data to do retrospective analysis and audits for your network.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_045", "question": "What are the key components of IPAM?", "answer": "The following are the key components of IPAM: A scope is the highest-level container within IPAM. An IPAM contains two default scopes. Each scope represents the IP space for a single network. The private scope is intended for all private space. The public scope is intended for all public space. Scopes enable you to reuse IP addresses across multiple unconnected networks without causing IP address overlap or conflict. Within a scope, you create IPAM pools. A pool is a collection of contiguous IP address ranges (or CIDRs). IPAM pools enable you to organize your IP addresses according to your routing and security needs. You can have multiple pools within a top-level pool. For example, if you have separate routing and security needs for development and production applications, you can create a pool for each. Within IPAM pools, you allocate CIDRs to AWS resources. An allocation is a CIDR assignment from an IPAM pool to another resource or IPAM pool. When you create a VPC and choose an IPAM pool for the VPC’s CIDR, the CIDR is allocated from the CIDR provisioned to the IPAM pool. You can monitor and manage the allocation with IPAM.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_046", "question": "Does IPAM support Bring Your Own IPs (BYOIPs)?", "answer": "Yes. IPAM supports both BYOIPv4 and BYOIPv6 addresses. BYOIP is an EC2 feature that allows you to bring IP addresses owned by you to AWS. With IPAM, you can directly provision and share their IP address blocks across accounts and organization. Existing BYOIP customers using IPv4 can migrate their pools into IPAM to simplify IP management.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_047", "question": "Does Amazon Provide Contiguous CIDR Blocks and how do they work with IPAM?", "answer": "Yes, Amazon Provides Contiguous IPv6 CIDR blocks for VPC allocation. Contigous CIDR blocks allow you to aggregated CIDRs in a single entry across networking and security constructs like access control lists, route tables, security groups, and firewalls. You can provision Amazon IPv6 CIDRs into a publicly scoped pool, and use all of the IPAM features to manage and monitor IP usage. Allocation of these CIDR blocks start in /52 increments, and larger blocks are available upon request. For example, you can allocate /52 CIDR from Amazon and use IPAM to share across accounts and create VPCs in those accounts.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}

Security and Filtering Close all", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_051", "question": "How do I secure Amazon EC2 instances running within my VPC?", "answer": "Amazon EC2 security groups can be used to help secure instances within an Amazon VPC. Security groups in a VPC enable you to specify both inbound and outbound network traffic that is allowed to or from each Amazon EC2 instance. Traffic which is not explicitly allowed to or from an instance is automatically denied. In addition to security groups, network traffic entering and exiting each subnet can be allowed or denied via network Access Control Lists (ACLs).", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_052", "question": "What are the differences between security groups in a VPC and network ACLs in a VPC?", "answer": "Security groups in a VPC specify which traffic is allowed to or from an Amazon EC2 instance. Network ACLs operate at the subnet level and evaluate traffic entering and exiting a subnet. Network ACLs can be used to set both Allow and Deny rules. Network ACLs do not filter traffic between instances in the same subnet. In addition, network ACLs perform stateless filtering while security groups perform stateful filtering.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_053", "question": "What is the difference between stateful and stateless filtering?", "answer": "Stateful filtering tracks the origin of a request and can automatically allow the reply to the request to be returned to the originating computer. For example, a stateful filter that allows inbound traffic to TCP port 80 on a webserver will allow the return traffic, usually on a high numbered port (e.g., destination TCP port 63, 912) to pass through the stateful filter between the client and the webserver. The filtering device maintains a state table that tracks the origin and destination port numbers and IP addresses. Only one rule is required on the filtering device: Allow traffic inbound to the web server on TCP port 80. Stateless filtering, on the other hand, only examines the source or destination IP address and the destination port, ignoring whether the traffic is a new request or a reply to a request. In the above example, two rules would need to be implemented on the filtering device: one rule to allow traffic inbound to the web server on TCP port 80, and another rule to allow outbound traffic from the webserver (TCP port range 49, 152 through 65, 535).", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}

Inter-Region VPC Peering traffic goes over the AWS backbone that has in-built redundancy and dynamic bandwidth allocation. There is no single point of failure for communication. If an Inter-Region peering connection does go down, the traffic will not be routed over the internet.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_115", "question": "Are there any bandwidth limitations for peering connections?", "answer": "Bandwidth between instances in peered VPCs is no different than bandwidth between instances in the same VPC. Note: A placement group can span peered VPCs; however, you will not get full-bisection bandwidth between instances in peered VPCs. Read more about Placement Groups.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_116", "question": "Is Inter-Region VPC Peering traffic encrypted?", "answer": "Traffic is encrypted using modern AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) algorithms.

{"id": "faq_123", "question": "How do I use ClassicLink?", "answer": "In order to use ClassicLink, you first need to enable at least one VPC in your account for ClassicLink. Then you associate a Security Group from the VPC with the desired EC2-Classic instance. The EC2-Classic instance is now linked to the VPC and is a member of the selected Security Group in the VPC. Your EC2-Classic instance cannot be linked to more than one VPC at the same time.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_124", "question": "Does the EC2-Classic instance become a member of the VPC?", "answer": "The EC2-Classic instance does not become a member of the VPC. It becomes a member of the VPC Security Group that was associated with the instance. All the rules and references to the VPC Security Group apply to communication between instances in EC2-Classic instance and resources within the VPC.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_125", "question": "Can I use EC2 public DNS hostnames from my EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC instances to address each other, in order to communicate using private IP?", "answer": "No. The EC2 public DNS hostname will not resolve to the private IP address of the EC2-VPC instance when queried from an EC2-Classic instance, and vice-versa.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_126", "question": "Are there any VPCs for which I cannot enable ClassicLink?", "answer": "Yes.

AWS PrivateLink Close all AWS PrivateLink enables customers to access services hosted on AWS in a highly available and scalable manner, while keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network. Service users can use this to privately access services powered by PrivateLink from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or their on-premises, without using public IPs, and without requiring the traffic to traverse across the Internet. Service owners can register their Network Load Balancers to PrivateLink services and provide the services to other AWS customers.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
{"id": "faq_131", "question": "How can I use AWS PrivateLink?", "answer": "As a service user, you will need to create interface type VPC endpoints for services that are powered by PrivateLink. These service endpoints will appear as Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) with private IPs in your VPCs. Once these endpoints are created, any traffic destined to these IPs will get privately routed to the corresponding AWS services. As a service owner, you can onboard your service to AWS PrivateLink by establishing a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to front your service and create a PrivateLink service to register with the NLB. Your customers will be able to establish endpoints within their VPC to connect to your service after you whitelisted their accounts and IAM roles.", "source": "AWS VPC FAQ", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/"}
