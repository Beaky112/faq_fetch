{"question": "What is “Open Source” software?", "answer": "Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition. The internationally recognized Open Source Definition provides ten criteria that must be met for any software license, and the software distributed under that license, to be labeled “Open Source software.” Only software licensed under an OSI-approved Open Source license should be labeled “Open Source” software.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000027"}
{"question": "Can Open Source software be used for commercial purposes?", "answer": "Absolutely. All Open Source software can be used for commercial purpose; the Open Source Definition guarantees this. You can even sell Open Source software. However, note that commercial is not the same as proprietary. If you receive software under an Open Source license, you can always use that software for commercial purposes, but that doesn’t always mean you can place further restrictions on people who receive the software from you. In particular, copyleft-style Open Source licenses require that, in at least some cases, when you distribute the software, you must do so under the same license you received it under.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000028"}

{"question": "What is “free software” and is it the same as “open source”?", "answer": "“Free software” and “open source software” are two terms for the same thing: software released under licenses that guarantee a certain specific set of freedoms. The term “free software” is older, and is reflected in the name of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), an organization founded in 1985 to protect and promote free software. The term “open source” was coined by Christine Peterson and adopted in 1998 by the founders of the Open Source Initiative. Like the FSF, the OSI’s founders supported the development and distribution of free software, but they disagreed with the FSF about how to promote it, believing that software freedom was primarily a practical issue rather than an ideological one (see for example the entry “How is `open source’ related to `free software’?” from the OSI’s original 1998 FAQ page).", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000031"}
{"question": "What is “copyleft”? Is it the same as “open source”?", "answer": "“Copyleft” refers to licenses that allow derivative works but require them to use the same license as the original work. For example, if you write some software and release it under the GNU General Public License (a widely-used copyleft license), and then someone else modifies that software and distributes their modified version, the modified version must be licensed under the GNU GPL too — including any new code written specifically to go into the modified version. Both the original and the new work are Open Source; the copyleft license simply ensures that property is perpetuated to all downstream derivatives. (There is at least one copyleft license, the Affero GPL, that even requires you to offer the source code, under the AGPL, to anyone to whom you make the software’s functionality available as a network service — however, most copyleft licenses activate their share-and-share-alike requirement on distribution of a copy of the software itself. You should read the license to understand its requirements for source code distribution.)", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000032"}
{"question": "What is a “permissive” Open Source license?", "answer": "All Open Source licenses are permissive! Some come with conditions – for example, a “copyleft” condition or a condition that authors be acknowledged – but any conditions must be satisfiable without reference to an external authority including the rights owner. Open Source licenses are not allowed to include restrictions which involve an additional step to remove, such as registration or purchase of additional licenses.The term “permissive” is also sometimes used as an antonym to “copyleft” but that usage is best avoided as it misrepresents copyleft conditions as restrictions.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000033"}

If you call it “Open Source” without using an approved license, you will confuse people.

{"question": "Is a license an Open Source license if it is just a few words different from a license listed on your web site?", "answer": "Many older licenses, such as the BSD license, have several variations that differ only by a few words or sentences. Unfortunately, it is not possible for OSI to approve every variation, so we cannot say if a specific variation is approved. Where possible, please avoid using these variants, and instead use the same version used on the OSI website.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000037"}
{"question": "What about software in the “public domain”? Is that Open Source?", "answer": "For most practical purposes, it is — sort of. This is a complicated question, so please read on. “Public domain” is a technical term in copyright law that refers to works not under copyright — either because they were never in copyright to begin with (for example, works authored by U.S. government employees, on government time and as part of their job, are automatically in the public domain), or because their copyright term has finally lapsed and they have “fallen into” the public domain. Not all jurisdictions have a public domain, and it doesn’t always mean exactly the same thing in the jurisdictions that do have it. Furthermore, even where it is clear what it means, it’s still not a license. To be subject to a license, a work must still be in copyright. That means there is no way for the “public domain”, as a concept, to go through the OSI evaluation and approval process. We wouldn’t be evaluating a license text. Instead, we would have to somehow evaluate the laws themselves, in different jurisdictions, and say which jurisdictions have a public domain that meets the Open Source Definition and does not create problems for software authors and users. This would be very difficult, because it would mean evaluating not just the statutes but various bodies of case law (for example, open source licenses usually have a strong disclaimer of liability for the copyright holder — but we don’t know how or whether the author would be protected from liability for software released into the public domain in various jurisdictions). This approach would not be useful to the OSI’s mission, because open source is an international phenomenon and we only want to approve licenses that meet the Open Source Definition everywhere.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000038"}
{"question": "What about the Creative Commons “CC0” (“CC Zero”) public domain dedication? Is that Open Source?", "answer": "At this time, we do not recommend releasing software using the the CC0 public domain dedication. Creative Commons Zero is a legal device known as a “public domain dedication”. It is essentially a statement of intent by the copyright holder to waive copyright ownership in the work — that is, the copyright holder wishes to place the work into the public domain. Because such a waiver is (perhaps surprisingly) not possible in all jurisdictions, CC0 also contains a “Public License Fallback” clause that goes into effect “should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law”. The fallback is essentially a copyright license that is very similar to an Open Source license, in that it gives up most of the restrictive powers associated with copyright, and allows redistribution and modification of the work.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000039"}
{"question": "What if I do not want to distribute my program in source code form? Or what if I don’t want to distribute it in either source or binary form?", "answer": "If you don’t distribute source code, then what you are distributing cannot meaningfully be called “Open Source”. And if you don’t distribute at all, then by definition you’re not distributing source code, so you’re not distributing anything Open Source. Think of it this way: Open Source licenses are always applied to the source code — so if you’re not distributing the source, then you’re not distributing the thing to which an Open Source license applies. You might or might not distribute binaries; that’s a separate question. But while some Open Source licenses allow you to distribute binary code without distributing the corresponding source, it is only the source code that can be “open source”. The binaries alone cannot be Open Source, because you’re not making any source code available to be open. (If someone else distributes the source code under an Open Source license, then that’s still Open Source, of course.)", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000040"}
{"question": "Which Open Source license should I choose to release my software under?", "answer": "You can choose any license from the open source licenses listed starting here: opensource.org/licenses. Most people select one from the “popular” category, but you are free to choose any listed license. If this is your first time choosing an open source license, we recommend that you find someone who has experience with open source licensing and talk to them about your project — that will help you choose the most appropriate license. The person doesn’t have to be a lawyer; it could be a developer who has experience releasing open source code. The section Choosing a License at the Civic Commons wiki may be useful, and you can learn more about open source licenses from, Section 3.2 of the eBook Introduction to Free Software by Hernandez, Jimenez, Barahona, Pascual, and Robles, and Karl Fogel’s book, Producing Open Source Software, Chapter 2, “Choosing a License and Applying It.”", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000041"}
{"question": "Which Open Source license is best?", "answer": "Unlike bilateral copyright licenses, which are negotiated between two parties and embody a truce between them for business purposes, multilateral copyright licenses — of which open source licenses are a kind — are community agreements. They express the consensus of how a community chooses to collaborate. They also embody its ethical assumptions, even if they are not explicitly enumerated. When that consensus includes giving permission to all to use, study improve and share the code without prejudice, the license is an open source license. The Open Source Definition provides an objective test of evaluating that such a license is indeed an open source license and delivers the software freedom we all expect. Since licenses are the consensus of communities, it is natural that different communities will have different licenses, that communities with different norms will find fault with the licenses used by others, and that all will regard their way as optimum. The arguments over this will be as deep as the gulf between the philosophical positions of the communities involved.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000042"}
{"question": "How do I apply <SOME OPEN SOURCE LICENSE> to software I’m releasing?", "answer": "This question isn’t actually specific to open source licenses — it’s really just about how to apply some particular copyright license (whether open source or not) to your software. Please note that the OSI is not a legal services organization and does not provide legal advice. However, many licenses come with instructions on how to apply them: for example, see the section “APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work” in the Apache-2.0 license, or the section “How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs” in the GPL-3.0 license. If the license you want to apply has such instructions, just follow them. If it does not, then look at the previous two examples (or at other licenses that contain similar instructions) and follow a similar recipe, adjusting for the license you’re actually using of course. The Software Freedom Law Center also maintains a guide on managing copyright information within open source projects. Finally, this guide may also help, though please note again that neither it nor this FAQ item constitutes legal advice.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000043"}
{"question": "What are “contributor agreements”? Are they like open source licenses?", "answer": "Many open source projects will only accept patches (code contributions or documentation contributions) from people who have submitted a legal document known as a contributor agreement. Contributor agreements are not open source licenses — rather, they are a way for the contributor to tell the project that it has the right to distribute the new contributions under the project’s existing open source license. (Some contributor agreements also allow for the project to distribute the contributions under other open source licenses too, which enables projects to change their license in the future, and some agreements even allow the project to distribute the contributions under any license the project wants.) There are two kinds of contributor agreements. In a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), the original contributor retains copyright ownership of their contributions, but grants the project a broad set of rights such that the project can incorporate and distribute the contributions as it needs to. In a Copyright Assignment Agreement (CAA), the contributor actually transfers copyright ownership of the contributions to the project, who can then license it however they want since they own it (but a CAA typically grants very broad non-exclusive rights back to the contributor so that they too can use, distribute, sublicense etc their contribution freely).", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000044"}
{"question": "Can I strip out the copyrights on Open Source code and put in my own?", "answer": "Definitely not! This isn’t even about Open Source, really: in general, you should not remove a valid copyright notice, no matter what license it specifies. Copyright notices are legal notices; they are also a source of information about the provenance of source code, and if that information is stripped out, recipients of downstream copies have no easy way to rediscover it.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000045"}
{"question": "Can I write proprietary code that links to a shared library that’s open source?", "answer": "Sometimes you can; it depends on the Open Source license. Authors often want you to be able to do this, so most shared libraries are licensed under a non-reciprocal license or one that allows linking under certain circumstances (e.g., the LGPL). A very small number of libraries use the GPL, which only allows linking with proprietary works if the licensor grants an explicit exception. Thus, you are wise to check the licenses that your program links to. The community expects that all code linked to GPL code will be licensed under the GPL, even if the link is made at runtime using a shared library.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000046"}
{"question": "I want to publish some code as Open Source code — can I get a license from you?", "answer": "As long as you own that source code, all that you need to do is choose one of the approved Open Source licenses, include a copy of the license text, typically in a filenamed “COPYRIGHT”, including a statement saying that you are licensing the code under that copyright, and give it to somebody else! Of course, you probably want to give it to a lot of people in order to gain the maximum benefit from giving away your code.

{"question": "Is <SOME PROGRAM> Open Source simply because it’s written in <SOME OPEN SOURCE LICENSED LANGUAGE>?", "answer": "No. While languages like PHP, Perl or Python have implementations that are licensed under Open Source licenses, that doesn’t turn all code written in these languages or run under such implementations into Open Source. The code written in such languages or run under such implementations would need to be licensed under an approved Open Source license in order to be Open Source.", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000048"}
{"question": "What is “distribution”? What does it mean to “distribute” a program? Is letting people use it on my server the same as distribution?", "answer": "Colloquially, to “distribute” a program means to give someone else a copy of its code — either its source code, or its binary (executable) code, or both. Merely allowing people to invoke a program on your server, for example via networked API calls, does not constitute distribution of the program as generally understood. To avoid confusion, some licenses use the terms “propagate” and “convey” instead of “distribute”. For example, in the GNU General Public License, version 3, to “propagate” means “…to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.” Even that leaves some question as to what “making available to the public” means. The definition for “convey” narrows it down, however: “…any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.”", "source_url": "https://opensource.org/faq", "type": "opensource_faq", "scraped_at": "2025-10-13 04:18:25", "id": "000049"}

{"question": "Does Open Source mean anybody else can use my name and logo?", "answer": "No, at least not any more than they could otherwise. Open Source is about software source code, not about identity.
